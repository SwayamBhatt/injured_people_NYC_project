Project Summary:

In this project, I developed an interactive and visually compelling data analysis application using a combination of powerful Python libraries and modern web technologies. The application was built with Streamlit to provide a seamless front-end experience, leveraging its caching capabilities to ensure efficient data processing by loading and running the dataset only once.

Pandas and NumPy were utilized for data pre-processing and analysis, enabling the cleaning, manipulation, and summarization of complex datasets. Pydeck was integrated to facilitate interactive 3D data visualizations on maps, allowing users to explore spatial data in an immersive way. Additionally, Plotly was used to create beautiful and responsive data visualizations, further enhancing the user experience with insightful and aesthetically pleasing charts and graphs.

Overall, this project demonstrates the effective use of data science tools and web technologies to create an interactive and user-friendly data analysis platform, providing users with a powerful tool to explore and visualize data.
